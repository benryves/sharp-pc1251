# Sharp PC-1251 audio adapter

The Sharp PC-1251 / TRS-80 PC1 audio connector lets you load and safe programs directly to a computer or phone.

It's easy to use and doesn't require a EC-125 or similar.

Most likely it also works with other 11-pin sharp models, but I haven't been able to test that yet.
